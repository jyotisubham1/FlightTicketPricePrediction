# Flight Ticket Price Prediction
### Overview
This project aims to predict the prices of flight tickets using machine learning techniques. The prediction model is developed based on historical flight data, including features such as departure time, arrival time, airline, and route. The goal is to provide accurate price estimates to assist travelers in planning their trips effectively.

### Steps
Follow these steps to use the Flight Ticket Price Prediction system:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
    -  Data Ingestion: Collect raw flight data from various sources, including CSV files or APIs.
    -  Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and perform necessary data cleaning operations.
    -  Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing ones and preprocess the data for modeling.
2. Model Training
    -  Model Selection: Choose appropriate regression algorithms for training the prediction model.
    -  Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
    -  Cross-Validation: Validate the model using techniques such as k-fold cross-validation to ensure robustness.
3. Evaluation and Testing
    -  Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model using metrics such as R-squared, mean absolute error, and root mean squared error.
    -  Testing: Test the model on unseen data to assess its generalization ability.
4. Deployment
    -  Integration: Integrate the trained model into a production environment, such as a web application or API.
    -  Monitoring: Implement monitoring mechanisms to track model performance and detect anomalies.
    - Feedback Loop: Continuously collect feedback from users and retrain the model periodically to improve accuracy.
### Usage
Follow these instructions to run the Flight Ticket Price Prediction system locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt'.
3. Run the main script (main.py) to execute the prediction pipeline.
4. View the results in the terminal or log files generated during execution.
